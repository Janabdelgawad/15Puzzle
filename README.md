## Project Overview
The **15 Puzzle** is a classic sliding puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles in ascending order by sliding them into the empty space.

This implementation focuses on:
- Generating a solvable initial puzzle state.
- Handling user input to move tiles.
- Displaying the puzzle grid in the console.
- Checking for a win condition.

## Features
- **Randomized Puzzle Generation**: The puzzle starts in a randomized but solvable state.
- **User Input Handling**: Players can use keyboard input (e.g., arrow keys) to move tiles.
- **Win Condition Detection**: The game checks if the tiles are in the correct order.
- **Text-Based Interface**: Simple console-based interface for gameplay.
